# Things to write about

- [x] The design of [Traversal](https://github.com/robrix/Traversal), including [non-recursive left folds as described by Oleg Kiselyov](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/fold-stream.lhs). [Underway](https://github.com/robrix/memory/blob/master/writing/folds.md).

- [ ] When & why Swift’s associated types being [functional dependencies](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_dependencies) (vs. higher-kinded types) isn’t enough

- [ ] How a type checker works; how types work

- [ ] How performance works

- [ ] How parsing works (I’ve done [something like this](https://github.com/robrix/A-Swiftly-Tilting-Parser) already)

- [ ] How compilers work
