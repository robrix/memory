# The fence

We want to raise the level of the fence up and build a trellis over the entrance to the patio. With a gate.

- Should block headlights from the parking lot.
- Should support morning glories.
- Should allow snow removal.
- Should allow us to exit via the patio despite snow.
- Should be within reach of my minimal carpentry skills.
