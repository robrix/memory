Iâ€™m quite fond of my Xcode project and file templates. I should publish them so that other people can be too. Some thoughts for potential features:


### General

- [ ] Include a `.gitignore` file.
- [ ] Restore the language dropdown?


### Frameworks

- [ ] Dropdown to select a `LICENSE` file.
- [ ] Pre-populate `README.md` with installation instructions.
- [ ] `.xcworkspace`.


### Files

- [ ] Swift `XCTestCase` subclass template.
